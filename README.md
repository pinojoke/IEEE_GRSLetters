# IEEE_GRSLetters

Image data set used for paper "Performance of compressive sensing image reconstruction for search and rescue" submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters [if accepted the correct citation goes here].

Structure of the repository is as follows:

1.) ORIGINALS - this directory contains all 11 original images in their full resolution (2560x1920) in JPG file format.

2.) MISSING SAMPLES - this directory contains all 11 images for different degradation levels (6 levels = 66 images) divided further into sub-directories with self-explanatory names. Since image degradation is based on random key, the images are included in Matlab *.MAT format so that later reconstruction can be reproduced by other researchers.

3.) RECONSTRUCTED - this directory contains all 11 images reconstructed for different degradation levels (6 levels = 66 images) divided further into sub-directories with self-explanatory names. Images are included in the JPG file format.
